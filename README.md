# Computational Methods for Music Analysis using User Inputted Audio
## This program uses the python library: Librosa to analyze .wav files that the user inputted. From there you can display and play your audio, Fourier Transform, Constant Q Transform, Spectrograms, Simple Waveform graph, chroma vectors and onset detection of your audio. By using Google Colab, it had a faster implementation than a platform such as Dataspell.
